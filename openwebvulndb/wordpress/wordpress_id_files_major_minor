Files to identify wordpress version when the readme.html file is present. Files choices done by the major-minor algorithm. Creates a signature for each major version with the identical files of the minor versions, then find the diff between all the major versions. After, find the diff between each minor versions in the same major version. For all diff, only the file that is the most common for alldiff is kept, others are discarded.
